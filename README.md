> **Maintained Fork & Package**: This repository is a fork of [`capitalstake/stockintel-trading`](https://github.com/capitalstake/stockintel-trading). It includes automated daily upstream synchronization, pre-compiled Protocol Buffer definitions, and a fully-typed, auto-reconnecting WebSocket client published to **GitHub Packages** as [`@umer2001/stockintel-trading`](https://github.com/umer2001/stockintel-trading/packages).

### Installation

To install packages from the `@umer2001` GitHub Packages registry, ensure your project's `.npmrc` includes:

```ini
@umer2001:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Then install the package:

```bash
pnpm add @umer2001/stockintel-trading
# or
npm install @umer2001/stockintel-trading
```

### TypeScript Client Quickstart

```typescript
import { StockIntelTradingClient, Market, OrderSide, OrderType } from '@umer2001/stockintel-trading';

const client = new StockIntelTradingClient({
  token: 'si_sb_YOUR_SANDBOX_TOKEN',
  otp: '54321', // sandbox OTP
  autoReconnect: true,
});

// Event listeners
client.on('welcome', (welcome) => {
  console.log(`Connected to environment: ${welcome.environment}`);
});

client.on('quote', (quote) => {
  console.log(`Quote: ${quote.symbol} Price=${quote.close} Vol=${quote.volume}`);
});

client.on('execution', (event) => {
  const ex = event.execution;
  console.log(`Execution: ${ex?.symbol} Status=${ex?.status} ExecQty=${ex?.quantityExecuted}`);
});

async function run() {
  await client.connect();

  // Subscribe to real-time quotes on PSX Regular Market
  await client.subscribeQuotes(['LUCK', 'OGDC', 'ENGRO']);

  // Place a test order
  await client.placeOrder({
    brokerCode: 'sandbox',
    clientCode: 'CS01',
    symbol: 'LUCK',
    market: Market.REG,
    side: OrderSide.BUY,
    type: OrderType.LIMIT,
    quantity: 100,
    price: 900.5,
    pin: '1234',
  });
}

run().catch(console.error);
```

The StockIntel Trading API is a real-time, low-latency **WebSocket** interface for placing and managing orders, querying account positions, and receiving live execution and market-session updates. The protocol speaks **Protocol Buffers** (proto3) over binary WebSocket frames — compact, typed, and efficient.

Designed for trading bots, algorithmic strategies, terminal applications, and broker integrations.

## Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Transport** | WebSocket over TLS (`wss://`) |
| **Public endpoint** | `wss://trading.stockintel.com/ws/v1` |
| **Wire format** | Protocol Buffers (proto3), binary frames |
| **Authentication** | Bearer token in the WebSocket upgrade `Authorization` header |
| **API style** | Command/response for reads; fire-and-acknowledge for orders; automatic server push for execution and session data; per-symbol subscriptions for market data |
| **Market data** | Real-time quotes and 10-deep order books by subscription, plus historical candles on request |
| **Rate limit** | 5 orders per second per connection, plus your plan's per-minute and daily quotas |
| **Environments** | Sandbox (test) and Live (production) — separate tokens |

## How It Works

```
┌──────────────────┐                         ┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Your App / Bot  │──── WSS + Protobuf ────▶│  StockIntel Trading API │
└──────────────────┘                         └─────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Connect** — Open a WSS connection with your API token in the `Authorization` header.
2. **Welcome** — The server immediately sends your environment, linked trading accounts and your plan's quotas. It may first require a one-time code before releasing them — check `Welcome.otp_required` and complete `SubmitOtp` if so. **Both environments are gated**: live codes are emailed, and the sandbox code is always `54321`.
3. **Real-time data flows automatically** — Execution reports and trading-session status are pushed from the moment you connect. No subscriptions needed.
4. **Send commands** — Place orders, cancel orders, list order history, fetch account balances and positions. Every command gets exactly one response, correlated by a UUID you supply.
5. **Subscribe to market data** — Quotes and order books are per-symbol and high-volume, so you name the symbols you want. Subscribing replays the latest snapshot immediately. Historical candles are a plain request/response.

## Key Design Points

- **Streaming-first** — Order lifecycle (submitted → queued → partial → filled) and market-session state are pushed to you automatically. You never poll.
- **Fire-and-acknowledge orders** — `PlaceOrder` returns an immediate empty acknowledgement. All outcomes (fills, rejections, cancels) arrive on the real-time execution stream, keyed by your own correlation ID.
- **One connection per token** — The WebSocket *is* your session. Sandbox and live are separate tokens, so you can run one of each concurrently. A token can only have one active connection at a time (newest-wins takeover).
- **Stateless server** — No server-side persistence. Reconnect and resync via the execution stream and `ListOrders`.
- **Snapshot market data** — Every quote and order-book message carries the symbol's full state, not a delta. A slow client has market-data frames dropped rather than its connection closed, and there is no gap recovery to implement: the next frame carries everything the missed one did.
- **Plan-scoped** — Order types, daily order count, request rate, concurrent subscriptions and historical depth all come from your plan, published in `Welcome.quotas` so you can read them rather than discover them by being refused.

## Quick Example

```
# Open a connection (protobuf binary frames, not text)
wss://trading.stockintel.com/ws/v1
Authorization: Bearer si_sb_aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ...
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: capri.v1

# Server pushes Welcome immediately, then you send commands as binary frames

# Place a market order (pseudo — actual frame is a serialized ClientFrame protobuf)
→ ClientFrame {
    request_id: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
    place_order: {
      broker_code: "sandbox"
      client_code: "CS01"
      market: MARKET_REG
      symbol: "AAPL"
      type: ORDER_TYPE_MARKET
      side: ORDER_SIDE_BUY
      quantity: 100
      time_in_force: TIME_IN_FORCE_DAY
      pin: "1234"
    }
  }

# Immediate empty ack
← ServerFrame { request_id: "550e8400-..."  place_order: {} }

# Then execution events stream in automatically
← ServerFrame { request_id: "550e8400-..."  execution_event: { status: SUBMITTED ... } }
← ServerFrame { request_id: "550e8400-..."  execution_event: { status: QUEUED ... } }
← ServerFrame { request_id: "550e8400-..."  execution_event: { status: FILLED ... } }
```

## Reference Client

A Python terminal client is available for developers to explore and test the API interactively:

**[stockintel-trading-client](https://github.com/capitalstake/stockintel-trading-client)** — a Textual TUI that connects over WebSocket + Protobuf and exposes all API commands (place/cancel orders, list accounts, get positions, session status, OTP verification) via keyboard shortcuts. Intended as a developer testing view, not a production application.

Use it to observe real protocol frames, test sandbox order outcomes, and verify your token and account setup before building your own client.

---

## Language Support

Protocol Buffers gives you generated, type-safe clients in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Java, C++, C#, Rust, and more. See the [Protobuf Guide](./protobuf.md) for compilation instructions and minimal client examples.

---

## Environments

| Environment | Token prefix | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Sandbox** | `si_sb_` | Test strategies with deterministic order outcomes. The sandbox broker accepts any symbol; order outcomes are controlled by quantity. |
| **Live** | `si_lv_` | Production trading with real brokers and markets. |

Always develop and test against the sandbox first.

> **Note:** Both sandbox and live tokens are only available to users who have opened a brokerage account with one of the available brokers through StockIntel, and require an active plan. Your plan also sets your API limits — daily orders, requests per minute, and available order types. See [Plan Quotas](./api-reference.md#plan-quotas).
